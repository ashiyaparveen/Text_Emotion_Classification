                                    TEXT Emotion Classification Project

# Overview of proj
This project aims to classify text messages into six emotion categories using deep learning techniques

# Dataset
3 DATASETS(TRAIN , VAL , TEST)
The dataset consists of 20,000 English text messages labeled with emotions. 
 
### TO RUNN THE PROJECT 
1. open vs code
2. simple run the train.py file 
3. you can see the output in the Terminal itself.

## Setup Instructions
1. Clone the repo
2. Install-> pip install -r requirements.txt
3. Run the training script to start the model training

# Approach I USED 
The model uses LSTM layers for sequence modeling and is trained on the provided dataset to achieve competitive accuracy.
